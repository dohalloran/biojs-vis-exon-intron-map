`npm install biojs-vis-exon-intron-map`  

## Getting Started
**Into the text area enter fastA formatted sequences with exons in uppercase and introns in lowercase**  
press **submit** and enjoy the exon:intron map. Deletions, SNPs, and knock-ins can also be decorated  

## Output
- Draw lines under sequence map to get forward and reverse primers 
- Visualize the forward primers as lines from left to right and reverse primers as lines from right to left
